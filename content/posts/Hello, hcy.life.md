# What to talk about

Once deciding to set up a new site, which audience to display to is a concret stuff needs to be considered primarily.

Maybe intuition bring me there. I bought the domain coincidencily yesterday, for the reason of its simple meaning *My Life*, 当然，我在尝试发布与另一个博客不同类型的内容，摄影，感悟，见解，摘录，心得，灵感…… Anyway，我通常把这些放在 Memos 里，但就像上面提到的，audience matters.

```bash
$ go build hcy.life.go
$ ./hcy.life.go
hello world
```
